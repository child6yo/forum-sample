## Forum sample

ðŸ‘‹
That's my simple pet-project - REST forum service sample.
I don't mind that it's pretty safety code for using in real projects.

The sercice is write using:
- Golang
- [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx)
- [golang-jwt/jwt](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/) for jwt bearer generation
- [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) for migrations
- [swaggo](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) for documentation
- [uber-go/mock](https://github.com/uber-go/mock) for service mocks
- [go-sqlmock](https://github.com/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock) for repository mocks

Service documentation is available after server startup at:
```
/docs/index.html
```
WARNING: for authentication in swagger (lock icon, after sign in) you have to use:
```
Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```
